# Concrete Productivity (Modified)

Modified version of the [Concrete Productivity](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/concrete-productivity) mod by [marc40k](https://mods.factorio.com/user/marc40k)

He suggested I upload this version since [he wanted to keep his mod as is.](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/concrete-productivity/discussion/6743129846891a81fe7fdf9a)

This version adds support for Dectorio's Concrete Grid and adds foundry recipes for it and refined concrete.
